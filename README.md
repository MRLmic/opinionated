<h1>Opinionated</h1>

<h2>An App for Debate</h2>

<a href="https://mrlmic.github.io/opinionated/">See it Live</a>
<p>This app allows users to enter discussion topics and add arguments on other users' topics.</p>

<p>The app works by adding hypotheses and arguments to a SQL database. The resources are displayed using Handlebars. The app regulates the edit and delete function on resources not created by the user via rails.</p>

<p>In the future, I would like to enable the users to vote on arguments they like and restrict the conversation so that a pro point can only be added after a con point. I'd also like to add a section for sources and add a mechanism for sources to be verified by the community using the app.</p>

<h2>Planning, User Stories & Wireframes</h2>
<p>To plan for this project, I first read over the project requirements and created a Trello board for myself. On this board, as I completed tasks I would move them to a "Done" column. I also created a "Wish List" column which included things like CSS tweaks I wanted to make, but were not required.</p>

<h3>User Stories</h3>
<ol><li>As a user I want to be able to create posts so I can participate in a discussion.</li>
<li>As a user I want to be able to edit my post (as long as no one has responded to it) in case I need to clarify something.</li>
<li>As a user I want to sign in to the app so no one can use my account.</li>
<li>As a user I want to be able to delete a post (as long as no one has responded to it).</li>
<li>As a user I want to be able to vote for posts I like to show my support for others users' arguments.</li></ol>
